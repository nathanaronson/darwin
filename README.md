# Darwin

A self-improving chess engine that evolves its own scaffolding via agentic tournament selection.

> Built at the Point72 Hackathon as a 24-hour, five-engineer build.

---

## Overview

Darwin asks an LLM to write a chess engine, then asks another LLM how to make it better, then asks two more LLMs to act on those suggestions, then plays the resulting candidates in a round-robin to decide who survives. Each pass through that pipeline is a **generation**. The next generation starts from the previous generation's winner.

Each generation runs four roles:

1. **Strategist** — looks at the reigning champion's source code and proposes concrete, distinct improvement directions (e.g. "add quiescence search", "add a transposition table", "weight the king-safety term more heavily").
2. **Builders (in parallel)** — each builder agent receives one strategist question, the champion source, and a chess library reference, and emits a complete Python module that satisfies the `Engine` Protocol.
3. **Validator** — static-source gates (forbidden imports, hallucinated `chess.X` attributes, missing `select_move`, etc.) plus a smoke game vs a `RandomEngine`. Anything that crashes, times out, or returns illegal moves never reaches the tournament.
4. **Tournament** — a round-robin of the surviving candidates plus the previous champion and its runner-up. Pairings play two games (one per color). Tournament scores decide who advances; Elo is tracked for the dashboard but does not gate selection.

The promotion rule is intentionally strict: the top scorer becomes the new champion **only if** it also beats the prior champion head-to-head. This stops a candidate that lucks out against weaker peers from displacing a champion it cannot actually beat.

The dashboard streams every move, every strategist question, every bracket result, and every Elo update over a WebSocket so you can watch a generation unfold in real time.

A second branch — written up in [`docs/experiment-pure-code.md`](./docs/experiment-pure-code.md) — flips the design from "LLM picks moves at play time" to "LLM writes a classical alpha-beta engine that plays without any LLM at runtime." That branch is local-only and is not on `main`.

## How to run

The repo ships a `Makefile` with all the common targets — run `make help` to list them.

### First-time setup

```bash
make install              # uv sync backend + npm install frontend
cp .env.example .env      # then fill in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (or GOOGLE_API_KEY)
uv tool install honcho    # only if you plan to use `make dev`
make seed                 # initialize the DB and insert baseline-v0 (idempotent)
```

### Picking an LLM provider

Set `LLM_PROVIDER=claude` (default) or `LLM_PROVIDER=gemini` in `.env`. Claude uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; Gemini uses `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. When switching, also update `STRATEGIST_MODEL`, `PLAYER_MODEL`, and `BUILDER_MODEL` to provider-appropriate values (e.g. `gemini-2.5-pro`). The strategist and builder agents both use function-calling, which is supported on both providers — call sites are unchanged.

### Running the dashboard

```bash
make dev                  # backend (:8000) + frontend (:5173) together via honcho
# or separately, in two terminals:
make backend
make frontend
```

Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and click **Run Generation**.

### Triggering a generation from the CLI

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/generations/run   # via the API
make run                                                 # one generation
make run N=3                                             # three back-to-back
```

### Other useful targets

```bash
make test                                       # pytest
make check                                      # lint + tests (pre-PR gate)
make smoke                                      # 10-move baseline self-play
make eval WHITE=baseline-v0 BLACK=random N=10   # head-to-head match
make replay                                     # re-emit persisted gens over WS
make reset                                      # drop the DB and re-seed
```

## Repository layout

```
backend/      Python: engines, agents, tournament, API, orchestration
frontend/     React + Vite dashboard
scripts/      One-off CLIs (run a generation, eval matches, smoke, replay)
plans/        Per-person build plans for the 5-engineer team
docs/         Reference docs (proposal, architecture)
```

### Frozen contracts

These define the interfaces between the workstreams — change them only with team sign-off:

- **Engine Protocol** — [backend/darwin/engines/base.py](backend/darwin/engines/base.py)
- **DB schema** — [backend/darwin/storage/models.py](backend/darwin/storage/models.py)
- **WebSocket events** — [backend/darwin/api/websocket.py](backend/darwin/api/websocket.py) and [frontend/src/api/events.ts](frontend/src/api/events.ts)

## Dependencies

### Runtime

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Python ≥ 3.11 | Backend runtime |
| [`python-chess`](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/) | Board state, move generation, SAN parsing |
| [`anthropic`](https://docs.anthropic.com/) | Claude SDK (default LLM provider) |
| [`google-genai`](https://ai.google.dev/) | Gemini SDK (alternate provider) |
| `fastapi` + `uvicorn` | HTTP API + WebSocket transport |
| `sqlmodel` | Persistence over SQLite |
| `pydantic` / `pydantic-settings` | Config + payload validation |
| `modal` | Optional remote tournament backend (one container per game) |
| Node ≥ 18 | Frontend toolchain |
| React 18 + Vite + TypeScript | Dashboard |
| `react-chessboard` + `chess.js` | Live board rendering |
| `recharts` | Elo charts |
| `tailwindcss` | Styling |

### Tooling

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — Python dependency + virtualenv manager (`make install` shells out to it)
- `honcho` — runs backend + frontend together for `make dev`
- `ruff` — lint + format
- `pytest` + `pytest-asyncio` — backend tests

### Required configuration

At minimum you need an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` if you set `LLM_PROVIDER=gemini`). Everything else has sensible defaults — see [`.env.example`](./.env.example).

## Improvements

What we built beyond the original 24-hour scope:

- **Two LLM providers behind one interface** — strategist/builder/player agents all go through `darwin.llm.complete*`, which dispatches to Anthropic or Google based on `LLM_PROVIDER`. Function-calling shape is identical on both sides.
- **Top-2 lineage** — the runner-up from each generation is carried into the next round-robin alongside the new champion. Stops the population from collapsing onto a single line of descent.
- **Hard promotion gate** — the top scorer only takes the throne if it *also* beats the prior champion head-to-head. Prevents lucky-pairing displacements.
- **Static + dynamic candidate gating** — forbidden imports, hallucinated `chess.X` attributes, missing required structure, and a smoke game vs `RandomEngine` all run before a candidate enters the tournament. Most builder failures are caught in <1 s instead of corrupting a 5-minute round-robin.
- **Optional Modal tournament backend** — flip `TOURNAMENT_BACKEND=modal` in `.env` and each game runs in its own Modal container. Real OS-level parallelism and frees the local machine; warmup runs in parallel with strategist + builders so it's a net win on wall-clock.
- **Live dashboard** — every move, strategist question, and Elo update streams over WebSocket. `state.cleared` events let one client wipe everyone's view in lockstep.
- **Replay command** — `make replay` re-emits the persisted event stream over WS. Designed as a demo safety net for when the live run misbehaves.
- **Pure-code engine experiment** — the [`experiment-pure-code-engines`](./EXPERIMENT_PURE_CODE.md) branch flips the design so the LLM *writes* a classical alpha-beta engine that plays in pure Python (no LLM at move time). ~50 ms per move instead of seconds, ~5 LLM calls per gen instead of ~1000.

## Shortcomings

We know about these. They are deliberate punts given the timeline, not surprises.

- **Selection is by tournament score, not Elo.** Highest cohort score wins; ties are broken randomly. Elo is persisted and shown but does not gate promotion. Over many generations this can let a slightly-noisier engine displace a slightly-stronger one.
- **No time-decay on Elo.** An engine that only ever played in generation 1 holds its gen-1 Elo forever (forward-fill in the chart). Useful for legibility, misleading for absolute strength comparisons.
- **Strategist question pool is small.** On the deterministic-strategist branch the rotation cycles after ~5 generations per category. On the LLM-strategist branch novelty depends on whatever the model is willing to suggest given recent history — empirically that also plateaus.
- **Builder failures are common at first.** ~30–50% of generated engines hit a static gate on the first turn. Logging tells you which gate killed which candidate, but the failure rate eats into the per-gen cohort size.
- **Mid-tournament dashboard state is stale.** The bracket's blue-highlighted "incumbent" row tracks the champion *coming into* the gen and only flips when `generation.finished` fires. Screenshotting mid-tournament shows stale state.
- **Single-machine SQLite.** Persistence is a SQLite file (`backend/darwin.db`). Fine for a hackathon and for `make replay`; not suitable for a long-running, multi-tenant deployment.
- **No resume.** If a generation crashes or the backend restarts mid-tournament, the partial state is dropped. The orchestrator restarts from the last persisted champion.
- **Modal backend is opt-in.** It works and is faster, but it's not the default — there are still some sharp edges around stale-event drainage when a generation is cancelled.
- **Pure-code branch is local-only.** It does not ship to `main`. Merging would require also bringing across the Modal deployment, the model env vars, and an API contract change for `ratings` on `generation.finished`.
