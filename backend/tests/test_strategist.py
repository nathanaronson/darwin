"""Tests for darwin.agents.strategist on the experimental pure-code branch.

The strategist is deterministic now — no LLM calls. Tests cover:
  - 4 questions returned, one per category in CATEGORIES_USED
  - All four categories distinct, all from the allowed set
  - Different generations get different question text (rotation works)
  - Optional kwargs (champion_code, runner_up_code, champion_question)
    are accepted without error and don't affect the output
