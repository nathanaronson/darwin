"""Person C — builder + validator.

The builder calls the builder model (default ``claude-sonnet-4-6``) with
a ``submit_engine`` tool, validates the returned source against several
static gates, writes it to ``engines/generated/<name>.py``, and returns
the path. The validator imports that path through Person A's registry,
runs another static-source pass, and plays one short game vs
``RandomEngine`` to confirm the engine doesn't crash.

Failure modes this module guards against, in order from cheapest gate
to most expensive:

  1. **Forbidden import** (``FORBIDDEN`` regex) — `subprocess`,
     `os.system`, `eval(`, etc. Build-time refusal.
  2. **No tool_use** — model replied with prose. Build-time refusal.
  3. **Missing required structure** (``REQUIRED_PATTERNS``) — no
     ``engine = ...`` symbol, no ``async def select_move``, no LLM
     call. Build-time refusal. These were the silent-zero-games modes
     before this gate was added: the builder would write a file, the
     validator would load it, but ``round_robin`` ended up with
     ``[champion]`` alone and scheduled zero games.
  4. **Static-source check at validate time** — same gates re-run
     against whatever's on disk, in case a hand-edited file in
     ``engines/generated/`` skipped the build path.
  5. **Module load** via ``darwin.engines.registry.load_engine``.
  6. **Smoke game** vs ``RandomEngine``. We reject any termination in
     ``REJECT_TERMINATIONS`` — not just ``error`` — so engines that
     return illegal moves or time out are dropped before they can
     pollute a real tournament.

Every gate emits a structured log line via ``logger`` so the operator
running the orchestrator can see exactly which gate killed each
candidate. When a build fails before writing, the raw model response
is persisted to ``engines/generated/_failed_<name>.txt`` so the failure
mode can be reverse-engineered later.
