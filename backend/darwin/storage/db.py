"""SQLite session helpers. Person E owns.

The database URL is read from `Settings.database_url` (defaults to
`sqlite:///./darwin.db` — a file next to the working directory).

`init_db()` is idempotent and should be called once at process start
(CLI runner, seed script, tests) before any `get_session()` usage.
`get_session()` returns a short-lived SQLModel session; prefer
`with get_session() as s:` so the connection is closed deterministically.
