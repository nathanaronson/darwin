"""Round-robin scheduler with bounded parallel game execution.

Local mode caps concurrency with ``settings.max_parallel_games`` so a
slow LLM provider can't make every game time out at once. Modal mode
fans every game out to its own container (real OS-level parallel,
GIL-free) which is the right choice for CPU-bound pure-code engines.
Toggle via ``settings.tournament_backend`` (``local`` | ``modal``).
