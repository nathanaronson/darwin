"""Remote tournament backend: dispatch each game to a Modal container.

Each ``play_game_remote.starmap`` invocation fans out one Modal container
per game in the round-robin. Containers run in real OS-level parallel —
no GIL ceiling — so a 20-game tournament that takes ~130 s locally
finishes in ~10–20 s wall-clock.

The remote function reuses ``darwin.tournament.referee.play_game`` for
the actual chess loop so the local-vs-remote behavior is identical
(same termination rules, same time budget, same fallback handling). It
captures events into a list and returns them; the local round_robin
re-emits them through the bus when the result lands. This means the
LiveBoards panel will update once per *game* completion rather than
per-move during the tournament — a small UX trade for the wall-clock
speedup. (Per-move streaming via ``modal.Queue`` is a follow-up.)

The Modal app is deployed once via:
    modal deploy backend/darwin/tournament/modal_runner.py
And re-deployed whenever the darwin package changes.
