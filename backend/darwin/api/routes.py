"""REST routes. Person E owns.

Thin read-only adapters over the three SQLModel tables plus two write
endpoints that drive the orchestrator. The live move/event stream is
served separately over `/ws` (see `server.py`).

Routes:
    GET  /api/engines            all engines ever seen, oldest-first implicit
    GET  /api/generations        all generations, ordered by number
    GET  /api/games[?gen=N]      games, optionally filtered to one generation
    POST /api/generations/run    cancel any in-flight generation; start fresh
    POST /api/generations/stop   cancel any in-flight generation; no replacement
    POST /api/state/clear        cancel + wipe DB + delete generated engines
