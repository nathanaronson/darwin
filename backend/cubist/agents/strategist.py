"""Person C — strategist agent.

Calls the strategist model (default ``claude-opus-4-6``) once per
generation with a ``submit_questions`` tool. The model must return
exactly 4 distinct improvement questions, each from a different
category in ``CATEGORIES``; we deduplicate on category and raise if
fewer than 4 distinct categories come back.

The free-form ``text`` of each question is shown verbatim in the
dashboard — keep it readable.

    Args:
        champion_code: source of the current champion module.
        history: prior-generation summaries (each generation: champion name,
            wins/losses, accepted question category, etc.). Empty on
            generation 1; otherwise the strategist may use it to ground its
            rationale.
        runner_up_code: source of the previous generation's runner-up,
            if any. Passed alongside the champion so the strategist sees
            both surviving designs and can ask questions that play to
            the gap between them. ``None`` on the very first generation.
        champion_question: the strategist question whose answer produced the
            current champion, as ``{"category", "text"}``. ``None`` when the
            champion is the deterministic baseline (no prior question).
            Surfaced so the strategist doesn't have to chain through history
            to identify what improvement it's building on top of.

        ValueError: if the model returns fewer than 4 distinct categories.
