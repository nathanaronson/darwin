"""Person C — builder + validator.

The builder calls the builder model (default ``claude-sonnet-4-6``) with
a ``submit_engine`` tool, validates the returned source against a
forbidden-imports regex, writes it to ``engines/generated/<name>.py``,
and returns the path. The validator imports that path through Person A's
registry and plays one short game vs ``RandomEngine`` to confirm the
engine doesn't crash.
